## ⚠️ Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### ✔ WickedWhims Not Showing / Inactive  
- Confirm **Script Mods** & **Custom Content** are enabled in game options.  
- Ensure the mod is in your Mods folder, not nested deep in subfolders.  
- Clear out `localthumbcache.package` (in The Sims 4 directory).  
- Make sure no duplicate copies of WickedWhims exist.

### ✔ “Script Call Failed” / Broken Animations  
- Download the latest official version of WickedWhims.  
- Remove old or conflicting animations/mod files.  
- Avoid very deep folder nesting (keep mod & scripts within 1 folder depth).  
- Restart the game.

### ✔ Version Mismatch / Compatibility  
- After each Sims 4 patch, rerun helper tool to reconfigure.  
- Do not mix versions: animations, compatibility packs, and core mod should correspond.
